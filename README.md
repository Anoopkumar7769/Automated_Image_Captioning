# Automated_Image_Captioning
This is completely a Deep Learning project, which makes use of multiple  Neural Networks like Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory to detect  objects and captioning the images. To deploy our model as a web application, we have used  Flask, which is a powerful Python's web framework. 
Note:Before running this project make sure your folder must have Images dataset and glove.6B.50d.txt along with the git code.
